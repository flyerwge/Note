Good morning ,  everyone . 

My name is gewei.

Today  i am going to show the topic about how to make chips

I will show my topic in three parts, First,what's the chip , 

Second, how to make chips 

and Third why do we need to make chips.

Firstly, let's see what's the chip.

In electronics, it is a miniaturization method that intensively manufactures circuits on the surface of a semiconductor wafer.

This is the definition of chips in Wikipeia.



Secondly, i will show how to make the chips.

It's a difficulty for us to make a fine chip.

The steps to make a chip are very complicated. Today i will introduce the steps briefly.

let's see the picture in the left.

 it describe the specific process of chip making

 To make a chip.



First,  we should purify silicon from sand to make wafers.

Second, coat a layer of photoresist on the wafer and expose it to the light source through the mask to etch the circuit. 



Now ,we get a circuit model.

Then, doping with some other metals to turn on the circuit.

Last, cutting and packaging into chips. 

A chip is born.



However, there are some dificulties in chip production.

We can look at  the pictures. 

In the left, it's the birth of the light source in the chip lithography process.

Achieving a suitable light source is very difficult. 

Now we need light sources with wavelengths around 13 nanometer

The right light source can make the chip production more precise.

In the right , we can see how to etch a circuit. 

The principle is very similar to camaera imaging.

But It's very difficult and important  in the whole chip making process.



Lastly , why do we need to make chips?

we can see in our life  a chip 

then it  can be used in many aspects of our lives,

such as the car, the TV, the computer , the pad and the smartphone.

Because of these devices , our life becomes moe convenient.

As our needs grow,the functions of the chip become more and more powerful

I love this kind of life. I also hope this life will get better and better.



The above is all , now my presentation is over , thanks for your listensing.
